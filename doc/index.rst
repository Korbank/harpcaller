About HarpCaller
================

HarpCaller is a system that allows calling procedures on remote machines and
collects their results of various types. Procedures to be called are part of
system's configuration, and their returned results can be inspected later and
multiple times.

HarpCaller is designed for building web panels for administrative tasks in
a robust and convenient way. It replaces running various scripts through SSH
and/or :manpage:`sudo(8)`, which is especially useful when the scripts accept
parameters.
