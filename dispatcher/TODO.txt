Things that would be nice to have, but are not critical for production at this
time:

== job result storage and retention ==

  * listing recorded jobs (including terminated ones)
  * timestamps in stream logs (already collected and stored; bubble it up to
    protocol and client library)

== communication with dispatcher ==

  * SSL listening sockets
  * client authentication
  * job deduplication mechanism
    * "call this function, but not if last call was less than 10 minutes ago"
    * similar to queues: dedup key (~queue name) and dedup parameters

== communication with daemon ==

  * verify daemon's SSL certificate (CN and subjectAltName fields)

== code internals ==

  * harpcaller_caller and harpcaller_tcp_return_{result,stream}: refactoring
  * harpcaller_caller: when dies, log this (harpcaller_log:error())
