Things that would be nice to have, but are not critical for production at this
time:

== job result storage and retention ==

  * listing recorded jobs (including terminated ones)
  * timestamps in stream logs (already collected and stored; bubble it up to
    protocol and client library)

== communication with dispatcher ==

  * SSL listening sockets
  * client authentication
  * job deduplication mechanism
    * "call this function, but not if last call was less than 10 minutes ago"
    * similar to queues: dedup key (~queue name) and dedup parameters

== communication with daemon ==

  * verify daemon's SSL certificate (CN and subjectAltName fields)

== code internals ==

== documentation ==

  * harpcaller(7): interpreting errors
    * communication with HarpCaller (timeouts, conn reset, bad protocol, ...)
    * HarpCaller operations (disk errors, unknown host, unknown job)
    * communication with harpd
      * nxdomain
      * IP/TCP/SSL connection problems (timeouts, connection reset, bad
        protocol, ...)
      * bad/unrecognized SSL certificate
      * ACK timeout
      * timeout/max_exec_time
      * invalid protocol
    * harpd operations (unknown procedure, invalid arguments, fork errors,
      process killed)
    * exceptions raised by the procedure
