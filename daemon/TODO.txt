Things that would be nice to have, but are not critical for production at this
time:

== harpd.proc ==

  ? harpd-level locks for procedures ("run only one at a time")
  * allow procedures to get authenticated user name and/or client's
    IP address as an argument
    * `info = False' -- default; don't add anything
    * `info = True' -- insert positional `info' struct as the first argument
    * `info = "kwarg_name"' -- insert `info' struct as keyword argument

== communication with daemon ==

== configuration ==

== documentation ==

  * harpcaller(7): interpreting errors
