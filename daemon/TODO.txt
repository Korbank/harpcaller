Things that would be nice to have, but are not critical for production at this
time:

== communication with daemon ==

  * connection forwarding (e.g. harpcaller -> harpd -> harpd)
    * intermediate harpd only forwards data left and right
    * raw TCP connection (SSL inside SSL)

== starting/stopping/restarting ==

  * bin/harpd --check-config
  * /etc/init.d/harpd try-restart
    * harpd --check-config && (stop; start)

== configuration ==

  * default UID/GID
